On the world map, use the arrow keys to navigate to a city. When you are on a city, it will display whether or not redcoats are attacking at the bottom of the game window. If redcoats are attacking a town, you can enter it by pressing "z". Once in town, jump on the redcoats to vanquish them. Collect their money, which you can then spend on stocks in New York. Speak with Alexander Hamilton by pressing "x". He will allow you to buy stocks. You can also take out a mortgage loan for a boat, which, in conjunction with insurance, will allow you to access the Chesapeake level. The information menu will explain the basic ideas behind Hamilton's services. If under any circumstances you cannot move, jump. If no towns are occupied by redcoats, pay Hamilton a visit. When you revisit the world map, redcoat presence refreshes. On the Chesapeake level, "z" and "x" fire your left and right cannons. If all redcoats on a level have been eliminated, press "c".

To win, garner a net worth of at least $15,000.

The game was coded in Aptana Studio 3 with the Akihabara HTML5/Javascript engine. Dropbox was used for collaboration.

Bug Report:
-In the Chesapeake, cannon fire collides only with the base of ships.
-Washington, if moving fast enough vertically, sometimes becomes stuck in the ground. He is freed by a jump.
